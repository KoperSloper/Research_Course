# Final Assignment for the Research Course

## Description
This repository contains Python scripts for the final assignment of the Research Course. The assignment involves an in-depth Instrumental Variable (IV) Regression analysis. The scripts perform data analysis and IV regression using various Python libraries, providing insights into the effects of community participation on income levels.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- linearmodels

## Installation
To run the scripts, you need to have Python installed on your system.

Once Python is installed, you can create a new Python environment and install the necessary libraries. Here's how you can do it using the command prompt:

1. Open the command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the new environment.
3. Run the following command to create a new environment named 'env':
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```
4. Activate the environment:
    - On Windows, run: `env\Scripts\activate`
    - On macOS and Linux, run: `source env/bin/activate`
5. Once the environment is activated, you can install the necessary libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels linearmodels
    ```

## Usage
After installing the necessary libraries, you can run the Python scripts in this repository.
